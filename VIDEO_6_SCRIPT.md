# Video 6: ***Working in community***

Hello everybody! I hope that you’re doing well. Welcome again. My name is ... Today we’ll talk about the AsyncAPI community. In this video we will tackle the following items:

- Collective strength
- Working as a community
- AsyncAPI Initiative and its community
- How to join the AsyncAPI community

## Collective strength

A engine is made up of many parts. They have different shapes, sizes, weight, thickness, function... but they are all important. None of them separately could propel you to advance a single centimeter. But, with all them working together, as a clockwork, they add strength enough for taking you many miles away and travel around the world.

Similarly, joined efforts achieve more than individuals. Collective strength is always higher than the sum of individual efforts.

But, how to find a space for everyone? Every social group needs some common ground to meet and develop its goals. Working, as well as playing music or enjoying free time, is primarily about sharing things, thoughts, challenges, obstacles, joy, sorrow... And, after all that, make a place of understanding and, hopefully, entertainment. 

Collectively, challenges are easier to overcome; everything seems smoother and funnier.

There is not much more to say about why AsyncAPI is devoted to work as a community. 

## Working as a community

A community is united by goals projected to the future, hoping to build something valuable. The projection of a reachable better place to be. Going slowly is possible to go farthest. 

Beyond generating a sense of belonging, communities facilitate the exchange of information, knowledge, and experiences, contributing to their members' personal and professional development. 

Communities are open and inclusive by definition. They are here to tackle and reverse the problems of physical communities. They somehow are very valuable not when shortening geographical and cultural distances, but also to restore the lack of social integration of groups discriminated within real communities.

## AsyncAPI Initiative and its community

As mentioned in previous videos, ***the AsyncAPI Initiative provides spec and tools managed and driven by its community. It’s a community open to anyone interested in participating in the specification. Everyone is welcome. AsyncAPI is devoted to forming a diverse community, comprising many people from different races, ethnicities, and cultures.***

***That's why AsyncAPI regularly participate in different mentoring programs dedicated to onboarding inexperienced people to the project and making the community more inclusive.***

***The majority of the AsyncAPI community members are developers, but it remains open to receiving all kinds of professionals who can contribute or collaborate with the project. Everyone has something to say. All kinds of ideas, opinions, inputs, or contributions are welcome. At the same time, all constructive criticism is taken into account to continue growing and improving.***

***AsyncAPI intends to make everyone feel welcomed, respected, and included in any project proposal, idea, or decision-making. It’s intended that the people who make up the community feel that the project is part of them, generating a sense of belonging.***

AsyncAPI is its community; the community is the engine that manages, maintains, and drives the specification. Summing up, the community is about gathering people with the same goals and vision to work as equals together, collaborate and drive the change at a much greater scale than it could be achieved as individuals.

[Voice-over for the animation- "AsyncAPI mainly relies on accepting difference as a virtue and valuing trust in people to construct a solid and coherent community. Feeling comfortable, welcome, trustworthy is the only way to create a sense of belonging. This combination is probably the secret to the constant growth of the community and of the project itself.

***If you’re not yet part of our community, we’re looking forward to it. We invite you to participate and enjoy yourself with us"].***

***The steps to joining our community are very simple: follow us on our social networks, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Youtube.***

***Join AsyncAPI's Slack, GitHub, and visit our website. We look forward to hearing from you and seeing how we can make the project better.***
