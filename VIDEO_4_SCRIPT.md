# Video 4: ***AsyncAPI and OpenAPI***

Hello again! My name is ... Welcome to a new video about AsyncAPI. If you wanna know more about the spec just check the previous video (3) on "What is AsyncAPI". This video will discuss what AsyncAPI and OpenAPI have in common and how they differ. 

Ready or not, here we go! 

## What is OpenAPI

***OpenAPI is a standard for describing application programming interfaces (APIs). This specification defines an open, vendor-independent description format for API services. In particular, OpenAPI can describe, develop, test, and document REST-compliant APIs. Understood as a software architecture for hypermedia systems on the World Wide Web, REST often uses the HTTP protocol.***

The current OpenAPI specification grew out of the predecessor project, Swagger. The development company SmartBear subjected the existing Swagger specification to an open license, handing over both maintenance and development of the initiative to the Linux Foundation. In addition to SmartBear, members of the OpenAPI initiative include industry giants such as Google, IBM, and Microsoft.

## ***Similarities between AsyncAPI and OpenAPI***

AsyncAPI's ultimate goal is to work with EDA architectures as simply as working with Rest APIs. For those who don't know what REST APIs are, we will briefly say that they defines a set of functions where developers can make requests and receive responses via the HTTP protocol. Because the REST API uses HTTP, they can be used by virtually any programming language and are easy to test. 

Back to the comparison, the AsyncAPI specification in the asynchronous world is analogous to OpenAPI in the synchronous world. 

More concretely, the similarities between these two specifications are the following:

- ***Contract-first philosophy, also known as API-first. They both prioritize design over implementation.***
- ***Implementation-agnostic, they are both compatible with various systems.***
- ***They have a similar syntax.***
- ***They use the same (or similar) tooling ecosystem.***
- ***They are both extensible.***
- ***They protect information consumption using different security schemes.*** (Example: user and password, API keys, certificates, OAuth, OIDC, etc.)

## ***Differences between them***

***As we have seen, the two initiatives are significantly similar, but they also cover different fields.***
 
***OpenAPI is a solution for REST, and AsyncAPI is a solution for message-based architectures. Each aims to serve a different domain.***

[Voice-over for the animation- "We could say that the big difference between the two is that OpenAPI, which focuses on synchronous communication, is used for HTTP protocol. AsyncAPI is used for multiple different protocols designed for async communication, Kafka, SNS, SQS, AMQP, MQTT, and Websocket"].

These are two complete distinct architectures that require different specifications. That is the main difference between OpenAPI and AsyncAPI. But, yeah, let's jump into details.

## AsyncAPI and OpenAPI comparison

Microservices architecture makes something pretty cool: to split up huge globs of code into tiny, manageable pieces. That’s the way different teams can work on pieces simultaneously, sharing the fun!***

***Combining microservices in different ways is the most efficient strategy to create a new application. Making combinations as a puzzle. REST calls were the main method to stick those pieces together, acting as glue.***

Jesse Menning makes it very clear in this fantastic [article](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/openapi-vs-asyncapi-burning-questions) that we highly recommend. We will leave a link to the article in the description box so you can check it out.

***OpenAPI worked pretty well in synchronous communication, but it has its limitations. People eventually realized that REST wasn’t always the best tool for playing the game. The search for a new kind of glue starts as a way of facilitating asynchronous communication.***

The internet of things acted as a real game-changer. Since it was introduced, everything seems to be connected to the Internet. And everything Is everything, including vacuum cleaners, heaters, ovens, cars... This is amazing but has its own complications because internet connection will sometimes fail which makes asynchronous communication the best solution to connect our gadgets.

One example of this are smartwatches. They put many essential functions and information from the mobile phone on our wrist and measure many body parameters.

Establishing asynchronous communication between microservices makes them more reliable, faster, easier to scale, and more agile to adopt. Let's look at an example:

[Voice-over for the animation- "The Rest architecture, the one not having a broker, sends notice steadily to see if a process has been completed. So, in this case, the waitress has to check every minute if there are customers or not to send the order to the kitchen and report it every time to the kitchen. The same goes for checking if the pizzas are ready or not. Consequently, there is a non-efficient use of energy and time wasted in unrealized actions"].

[Voice-over for the animation- "In the case of AsyncAPI, which works with EDA, the system has a broker, which acts as an intermediary between the messages and the system. This one coordinates and manages the entire communication process"].

***AsyncAPI and OpenAPI are now both under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation. That beautiful coincidence facilitates its combined used, opening a world of API possibilities that can be explored and covered.***

Being hosted by Linux Foundation, it is possible to say that AsyncAPI and OpenAPI share a wide common ground, well supported and stable. They share open standards with community governance. They should also continue to be integrated with open-source tooling and commercial products.

Both are heading straight to a promising future, wide open.
